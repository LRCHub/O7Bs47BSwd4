How I love to say hello
When time is on our side
Feels like a lifetime left to go
A long way from goodnight
But the glass is ever turning
And the sand can fall so quick
No one tells you our farewell
Is closer than you think
Now I gotta go, go, go
Another airplane, another show
Twenty songs if they love me
Only eighteen if they don't
I'm gonna fly
Many miles until you're mine
How many nights and highway lines
I don't know
But I gotta go, go, go
Hurry now and hold me
While we still got the chance
The clock is cruel and a moment true
Can slip right through your hands
I don't wanna run from wreckage
When we sail away
I only want to see your smile
Shining in my wake
When I gotta go, go, go
Another airplane, another show
Twenty songs if they love me
Only eighteen if they don't
And I'm gonna fly
Many miles until you're mine
How many nights and highway lines
I don't know
But I gotta go, go, go
And I'll be looking over my shoulder
When we hit the open road
For the only thing that hurts you
More than leaving
Is when you don't
With one eye on the spotlight
And one foot out the door
I'll have to beg your pardon like
So many nights before
'Cause I gotta go, go, go
How I loved to say hello
When time was on our side
When love was new and me and you
Were younger than the night
I hope we've come to know we've had
The time of our lives
'Cause we had the time of our lives
How I love to say hello
And I hate to say goodbye
But I gotta go, go, go
Another airplane, another show
Twenty songs if they love me
Only eighteen if they don't
And I'm gonna fly
Many miles until you're mine
How many nights and highway lines
I don't know
'Cause I gotta go, go, go
Another airplane, another show
Twenty songs if they love me
Only eighteen if they don't
And I'm gonna fly
Many miles until you're mine
How many nights and highway lines
I don't know
But I gotta go, go, go
I gotta go, go, go
I gotta go
