Go! I don' t know where we can go but we will
Look for that place where everything is grass and
Trees and thoughts have wings
Go! ' Cause I gotta go
Go! To look for the place where you can run
F nacked and girls are slaves ofmen and that's not hell
Go! 'Cause I gotta go
We're not going if you don't
We ' re not going without you. .
